# sanity test
## setup
Connect 1.8v to pin 7 and gnd to pin 1 of the input connector (J1). Power consumption should be only a few milliampere.
## results
untested

# shutdown test
## setup
connect the two pins of the pinheader (J2) together and unpopulate R1. Power consumption should be only a few microvolts.
## results
untested

# full power test
## setup
Connect 1.8v to pin 7 and gnd to pin 1 of the input connector. Connect a variable resistor between the output (pin 9 of J3) and GND. Start at 1k and adjust the resistor down to about 40R noting the output voltage (pin 9 to pin 1 of J3) at different intervalls.
